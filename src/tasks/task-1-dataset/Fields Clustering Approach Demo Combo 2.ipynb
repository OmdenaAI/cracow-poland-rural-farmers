The core functions are stored in the fields_functions.py file, which references a file with global parameters, the global_config.py file, that stores parameters in a dictionary. Refer to that file to see what each parameter controls. Changing parameters can be done interactively in this notebook by reassigning new values to the parameter, such as: `config['prep_file_dir'] = 'path/to/directory/with/sentinel/tiles/'` \n","\n","Since there are multiple ways to load and process data, this notebook should not be run sequentially in full. The first step is loading the data. This can be done by using the `prep_data()` function to load data from a directory of zipped .SAFE Sentinel-2 L2A tiles. Since these tiles are large (about 1 GB per tile), the data is not directly available with the code. In order to enable testing of the analysis code, we have provided a sample dataset as part of thie repo. To load that, run the cell under the \"Load Sample Data\" heading.\n","\n","NOTE: In addition to the text description, most of the code is commented for clarity."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"BSqZw5wMGuIe"},"source":["### Import packages\n","\n","First, check the contents of the current working directory to make sure the python files with the functions and global parameters are accessible.

Each Sentinel tile was divided into 4 equal pieces, passed through the preprocessing, and then passed to a k-means clustering model. This is how the statewide sampling was achieved. Instead of preprocessing the entire state and taking a sample from the entire state, a random sampling of tiles from each quarter tile area was passed through its own k-means model to find the cluster centers for that area. This stratified random sampling approach ensured each major cover type across the state was represented in the sampling. The cluster centers from each of these quarter tile sample areas was saved out as a netCDF file. Once the entire state had been sampled, we passed all the cluster centers from the sampled quarter tiles to a final k-means model. This two step clustering approach enabled much quicker modeling and experimentation at the statewide level since it did not require the entire state to be clustered randomly every time, which is computationally intensive.
